# The Odin Project - TOP  

If you read this repo so, I had won the battle against my built-in enemies (**procrastination** and fear of didn't make it well ).

## what's this repo about?
It's a progress tracker for my **MERN** stack journy through **TOP**  i'll upload my projects here and reports will be in 
[my blog](https://ahmedgamal73.github.io), i'll try to post on it weekly.

## why TOP? 
I was following  javascript fullstack [curriculum](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y6yScW88oaN5jHgcyo6PrCcGKL8STSD5nDrziFqpR4A/edit) 
[**Eng.Ahmed Fathy**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedfathykhalid/?originalSubdomain=eg) the founder of this curriculum

reached to the JAVASCRIPT (REACT AND NODE) section 
then can't complete, cause i prefere the typed based courses and books and alot of researchs (articles, decomntations and videos) and i love to read.

so i tryed to find the alternative for this section 

 and finally had found what i was searching about  it's [**TOP**]()
 
  TOP advantages:
 - well organized
 - alot of projects 
 - they get you into the world of web step by step at the begining and tell you what expected from you to fell and know each section
 
## Mindset
I will give it 3/5 hours per day, Cause i'm working full time job
expected to finish in October 2022, and upload about **27 projects** on github, I'll try to finish atleast one project each week.
